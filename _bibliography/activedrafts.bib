  abstract =    {This document presents a distributed mechanism to enforce strict delay bounds for some network flows in large scale networks. It leverages on the capacity of modern network devices to adapt their queue's capacities to bound the maximum time spent by packets in those devices.  It is using a reservation protocol to guarantee the availability of the resources in the devices' queues to serve packets belonging to specific flows while enforcing an end-to-end delay constraint.},

  abstract =    {  The Internet Protocol (IP) has been the major technological success in information technology of the last half century.  As the Internet becomes pervasive, IP has been replacing communication technology for many domain-specific solutions, but it also has been extended to better fit the specificities of the different use cases.  For Internet addressing in particular, as it is defined in RFC 791 for IPv4 and RFC 8200 for IPv6, respectively, there exist many extensions.  Those extensions have been developed to evolve the addressing capabilities beyond the basic properties of Internet addressing.  This document discusses the properties the IP addressing model, showcasing the continuing need to extend it and the methods
   used for doing so.},

This document focuses on carrying IP packets across an LLN (Low power and Lossy Network), in which the topology is static, the location of the nodes is fixed, and the connection between the nodes is also rather stable. This specifications describes the PASA architecture, along with PASA address allocation, forwarding mechanism, header format design, and IPv6 interconnection support.},

This memo tackles specifically reliability in PASA deployments, analyzing possible broad solution categories to solve the issue.},

  abstract =    {This memo describes an approach to updating topologies in typical MANET-like environments, relying on what is termed 'sloppy updates' in the remainder of this document.  Key to the approach is that updates are only initiated if existing communication relations may be effect by non-synchronized topology information, otherwise using the topology information as it exists.  This 'sloppy' nature of the approach reduces the needed updates and the associated communication for them, thus increases efficiency as well as performance from a user perspective.  As such, STURP does not provide a complete routing protocol solution but is intended to extend existing routing protocols with this improved efficiency mechanism instead.},
