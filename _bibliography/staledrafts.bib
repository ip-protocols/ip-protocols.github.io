As the Internet becomes pervasive, IP has been replacing communication technology for many domain-specific solutions.

  abstract =    {There exist many extensions to Internet addressing, as it is defined in [RFC0791] for IPv4 and [RFC8200] for IPv6, respectively.  Those extensions have been developed to fill gaps in capabilities beyond the basic properties of Internet addressing.  This document outlines those properties as a baseline against which the extensions are categorized in terms of methodology used to fill the gap together with examples of solutions doing so.
  While introducing such extensions, we outline the issues we see with those extensions.  This ultimately leads to consider whether or not a more consistent approach to tackling the identified gaps, beyond point-wise extensions as done so far, would be beneficial.  The benefits are the ones detailed in the companion document [I-D.jia-intarea-scenarios-problems-addressing], where, leveraging on the gaps identified in this memo and scenarios provided in [I-D.jia-intarea-scenarios-problems-addressing], a clear problem statement is provided.},
